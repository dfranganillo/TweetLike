TweetLike
=========
About
-----
A full Mojolicious app built around Net::Twitter.

The idea around Tweetlike is to make sharing tweets in other social networks (like Facebook) an easier task.

Installation
------------
First things first, clone the repository. After that you must make your own twitter app and get your own secret/key tokens.

After that, make your own app.conf file using app.conf.example as a template.
